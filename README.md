## Description
This file contains my final frogger project. As the frog, you must avoid obstacles (cars, logs, and turtles) in order to get to one of the four lily pads. Falling in the water, going into the tunnel, or getting hit by a car will take a life from your frog. You must take all four lily pads before losing your 3 lives.
