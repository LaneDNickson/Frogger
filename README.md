## Description
This repository contains my final project for a graphics class that I took. It is a clone of the classic arcade game of [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) using [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/). As the frog, you must avoid obstacles (cars, logs, and turtles) in order to get to one of the four lily pads. Falling in the water, going off of the screen, or getting hit by a car will take a life from your frog. You must take all four lily pads before losing your 3 lives.
